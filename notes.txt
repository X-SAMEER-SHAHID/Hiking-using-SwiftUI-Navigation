SwiftUI Navigation Learning Notes:

1. NavigationStack
   - Basic container for navigable content
   - Manages navigation hierarchy and history
   - Replaces older NavigationView in modern SwiftUI

2. Navigation Modifiers
   - .navigationDestination(for:destination:) 
     * Used to define where navigation leads for specific data types
     * Takes a data type and a view builder
     * Example: .navigationDestination(for: Hike.self) { hike in ... }

3. Navigation Elements
   - NavigationLink
     * Creates tappable elements that trigger navigation
     * Can be bound to data
   - .navigationTitle()
     * Sets the title in the navigation bar

4. Data-Driven Navigation
   - Can pass entire models through navigation
   - Allows for type-safe navigation using generics
   - Makes it easy to show detail views for specific data types

5. Best Practices
   - Keep navigation logic separate from view content
   - Use strong typing for navigation destinations
   - Consider using navigation path for deep linking

6. Additional Features
   - Custom back buttons
   - Programmatic navigation
   - Navigation bar customization
